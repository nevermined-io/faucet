## Prerequisites

- Node.js v12 or later
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Nevermined Tools](https://github.com/keyko-io/nevermined-tools)

## Get Started

Before starting to develop, you need to run a local Nevermined network using [Nevermined Tools](https://github.com/keyko-io/nevermined-tools):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keyko-io/nevermined-tools.git
cd nevermined-tools
./start_nevermined.sh --no-faucet --latest
```

Then, start the Faucet server in a live-reloading watch mode:

```bash
docker-compose up -d mongo
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage

### `POST /faucet`

To request Ether, a user can send an HTTP POST request to `http://localhost:3001/faucet` with an HTTP request body like:

```js
{
    "address": "<string>", //required
    "agent": "<string>",   //optional, Possible values - server, twitter, telegram, gitter
}
```

An example HTTP POST request using `wget`:

```bash
wget --header="Content-Type: application/json" \
--post-data '{"address": "0x0823876a9973a66e049a15E763c97CB726765f87", "agent": "twitter"}' \
http://localhost:3001/faucet
```

Sample Response Body:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully added 3 ETH to your account.",
  "txHash": "0xaacc762b870055deee924aeb33c08c162abdb6a71faa8531dbba84e985402b64"
}
```

An error response looks like this:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Crypto is hard."
}
```

### `GET /`

Shows information about the software version, which will be returned as HTML by default to be more human-friendly when accessed from a browser.

To get a json response instead, set the `Accept` header to `application/json`:

```bash
wget --header="Accept: application/json" \
http://localhost:3001/
```

Sample Response Body:

```json
{
  "software": "faucet",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "network": "Spree",
  "keeper": "http://keeper-node:8545"
}
```


## Testing

Before running the tests, configure your test environment variables if needed and make sure MongoDB service is running:

```bash
cp tests/.env.test.example tests/.env.test
docker-compose up -d mongo
```

Then start the unit tests:

```bash
npm test
```

To get a test coverage report:

```bash
npm run coverage
```

## Production build

To create a production build of the Faucet server, execute:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create the build output into `./dist`. You can then run and serve from this build output with:

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Deployment

You can deploy the Faucet server using `docker-compose`. The Docker image will do a production build of the server and run it:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
